## Project Description
This project is an online book purchasing application where users 
can browse a catalog of books and view key details such as author,genre, price, rating, and availability. 
The application is designed to be expanded in future sprints to support features like wishlists, shopping carts, and order tracking.
 
## User Stories

## Sprint 1 Scope

creating a good BookCatalog component that renders a list of books , 
and integrating this component into the main application layout with a consistent style guide.
