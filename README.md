## Project Description  
This project is an online book purchasing application where users can browse a catalog of books and view details such as title, author, price, and book cover images. Users can also save books to a wishlist so they can keep track of what they want to read or buy later.

The application is being developed in multiple sprints and is designed to grow with more features like user accounts, shopping carts, and order tracking in the future.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to view book details like price and cover images, so I can better decide what I want to read or buy.  
- As a user, I want to add and remove books from a wishlist, so I can save my favorite books for later.

## Sprint 1 Scope  
In Sprint 1, we focused on setting up the project using React and TypeScript. We created the base structure of the app, including a Book Catalog component that displays a list of books. We also added a Header and Footer and created a style guide to keep the design consistent across the application.

## Sprint 2 Scope  
In Sprint 2, we worked on turning the project into a multi-page application. We added navigation between pages using routing and connected the Catalog and Wishlist using shared state. We also added book images, a search feature for filtering books, and improved the overall layout and user experience.
